To get your website up and running, follow these steps to ensure each component of your project is properly set up and connected:

### 1. **Set Up Backend**

#### a. **Install Dependencies**

Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### b. **Run Migrations**

If using Django, apply migrations to set up your database schema:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

If using Flask, ensure that your database is set up and migrations are applied as needed.

#### c. **Start Backend**

Choose the appropriate script to start your backend:

For Django:
```bash
cd ../scripts
./start_backend_Django.sh
```

For Flask:
```bash
cd ../scripts
./start_backend_Flask.sh
```

### 2. **Set Up Database**

#### a. **Run Seed Script**

Navigate to the `database` directory and run the seed data script to populate your database with initial data:

```bash
cd database
python seed_data.py
```

### 3. **Set Up Frontend**

#### a. **Install Dependencies**

Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### b. **Build Frontend**

Run the build script to compile your Vue.js application:

```bash
cd ../scripts
./build_frontend.sh
```

#### c. **Start Frontend**

Serve your Vue.js application:

```bash
npm run serve
```

### 4. **Set Up Docker (if using Docker)**

#### a. **Build Docker Images**

Build the Docker images as specified in your `Dockerfile`:

```bash
docker build -t your-backend-image .
```

#### b. **Start Docker Containers**

Use Docker Compose to start all services:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 5. **Deploy to AWS (if applicable)**

#### a. **Deploy Infrastructure**

Use the deployment script to set up your AWS resources:

```bash
cd scripts
./deploy.sh
```

Ensure that your CloudFormation templates in `cloudformation/` are correctly configured for your AWS setup.

### 6. **Run Tests**

#### a. **Backend Tests**

Run the backend tests to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
cd tests/backend
pytest test_api_pytest_Django.py  # For Django
pytest test_api_unittest_Flask.py  # For Flask
```

#### b. **Frontend Tests**

Run frontend tests to verify your Vue.js components:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm run test:unit
```

#### c. **Integration Tests**

Run integration tests to ensure end-to-end functionality:

```bash
cd ../integration
python test_checkout_flow.py
```

### 7. **Verify Everything**

- Open your browser and navigate to the local server (typically `http://localhost:8080` for Vue.js and `http://localhost:8000` for Django/Flask).
- Ensure all pages load correctly, and all features (product listings, checkout, etc.) work as expected.

### 8. **Debugging**

- **Check Logs**: Review the logs from Docker, the backend server, and the frontend build process to troubleshoot any issues.
- **Update Configurations**: Make sure all configurations (e.g., environment variables, API endpoints) are correctly set in your `.env` file and your code.

By following these steps, youâ€™ll set up, run, and verify each component of your website to ensure everything works together as expected.


To integrate PayPal for payment processing, here are the steps you can follow:

### 1. Set Up PayPal Developer Account
- **Create an account** on [PayPal Developer](https://developer.paypal.com/).
- **Create sandbox accounts** (buyer and seller) for testing.
- **Generate client ID and secret** from the PayPal Developer Dashboard.

### 2. Backend Setup
- **Install PayPal SDK**: Use the PayPal Python SDK to handle backend integration.
  ```bash
  pip install paypalrestsdk
  ```
- **Configure PayPal SDK**: In your backend, initialize the PayPal API with your client ID and secret.
  ```python
  import paypalrestsdk
  paypalrestsdk.configure({
      "mode": "sandbox",  # or "live" for production
      "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
      "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
  })
  ```

### 3. Create Payment Endpoint
Set up an endpoint in your Flask app to create a payment.
```python
@app.route('/create_payment', methods=['POST'])
def create_payment():
    payment = paypalrestsdk.Payment({
        "intent": "sale",
        "payer": {"payment_method": "paypal"},
        "redirect_urls": {
            "return_url": url_for('execute_payment', _external=True),
            "cancel_url": url_for('cancel_payment', _external=True)
        },
        "transactions": [{
            "item_list": {
                "items": [{
                    "name": "Item Name",
                    "sku": "item",
                    "price": "10.00",
                    "currency": "USD",
                    "quantity": 1}]},
            "amount": {"total": "10.00", "currency": "USD"},
            "description": "Payment description"
        }]
    })

    if payment.create():
        for link in payment.links:
            if link.rel == "approval_url":
                return redirect(link.href)
    else:
        return "Payment creation failed"

```

### 4. Execute Payment
Handle the return from PayPal with another route to execute the payment.
```python
@app.route('/execute_payment', methods=['GET'])
def execute_payment():
    payment_id = request.args.get('paymentId')
    payer_id = request.args.get('PayerID')
    payment = paypalrestsdk.Payment.find(payment_id)

    if payment.execute({"payer_id": payer_id}):
        return "Payment executed successfully"
    else:
        return "Payment failed"
```

### 5. Frontend Payment Form
Create a payment button on your frontend.
```html
<form action="/create_payment" method="post">
    <button type="submit">Pay with PayPal</button>
</form>
```

### 6. Handle Payment Responses
Display success or failure messages based on the responses from PayPal. You can update your front end accordingly after the payment is processed.

### Tools:
- **PayPal Developer Dashboard** for configuring credentials.
- **PayPal SDK (paypalrestsdk)** for handling payment requests and responses.

This will help you integrate PayPal successfully for your project.
