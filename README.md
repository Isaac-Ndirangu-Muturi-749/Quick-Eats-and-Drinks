## Setup and Installation

To set up and run the Quick Eats & Drinks Store project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Isaac-Ndirangu-Muturi-749/Quick-Eats-and-Drinks-Store.git
   cd Quick-Eats-and-Drinks-Store
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   conda create --name my_env python=3.10
   conda activate my_env
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setup Environment Configuration

1. **Create a `.env` File**

   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project. This file should contain environment-specific variables, such as database configurations and secret keys. Below is a template you can use:

   ```ini
   # .env

   # Database Configuration
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///site.db

   # PayPal Configuration
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_paypal_client_secret

   # Secret Key for Flask Sessions
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

   Replace `your_paypal_client_id`, `your_paypal_client_secret`, and `your_secret_key` with your actual PayPal API credentials and Flask secret key.

   The application uses the `python-dotenv` package to load environment variables from the `.env` file. Install it using:

   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv
   ```

   In the application setup (i.e., `app/__init__.py`), load the environment variables like this:

   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   import os

   load_dotenv()

   # Example of accessing environment variables
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = os.getenv('PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID')
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv('PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET')
   SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
   ```

   Ensure that your PayPal payment routes and configurations use these environment variables.

## Setup the Database

Follow these steps to set up and initialize the database:

a. **Remove Existing Migrations Folder and Database File**:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf ./migrations/
   sudo rm -f ./instance/site.db
   ```

b. **Initialize the Migration Repository**:

   ```bash
   flask db init
   ```

c. **Generate an Initial Migration Script**:

   ```bash
   flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
   ```

d. **Apply the Migration to the Database**:

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

e. **Create the Admin User**:

   ```bash
   python create_admin.py
   ```

f. **Seed the Database with Initial Data**:

   ```bash
   python seed.py
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use the following command to initialize and seed the database:

   ```bash
   bash db_setup_and_seed.sh
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the application, use:

   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

   The application will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

## Running Tests

To run the tests for the project, use:

   ```bash
   python run_tests.py
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

   This will execute all the tests defined in the `tests` directory and ensure everything is functioning as expected.
