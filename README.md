## Project Overview

Quick Eats & Drinks provides a user-friendly interface for managing food and drink orders. Users can view products by category, place orders, and track their order history. Administrators have access to a dashboard where they can add, edit, or delete products and product groups.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and manage user accounts.
- **Product Management**: Browse products, view details, and add items to the cart.
- **Order Processing**: Place orders and proceed to checkout.
- **Order History**: View past orders and track order status.
- **Admin Interface**: Manage products, product groups, and user accounts.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (stylesheets in `static/css`), JavaScript (in `static/js/menu.js`).
- **Backend**: Flask (Python framework), SQLAlchemy (ORM for database management).
- **Database**: SQLite (for development and testing), PostgreSQL (for production).
- **Payment Integration**: PayPal.
- **Testing**: pytest for integration testing.

## Setup and Installation

To set up and run the Quick Eats & Drinks project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Isaac-Ndirangu-Muturi-749/Quick-Eats-and-Drinks.git
   cd Quick-Eats-and-Drinks
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
    conda create --name my_env python=3.10
    conda activate my_env
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setup Environment Configuration

This section provides instructions for creating and configuring the `.env` file and integrating PayPal API credentials into the application.

1. **Create a `.env` File**

   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project. This file should contain environment-specific variables, such as database configurations and secret keys. Below is a template you can use:

   ```ini
   # .env

   # Database Configuration
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///instance/site.db

   # PayPal Configuration
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_paypal_client_secret

   # Secret Key for Flask Sessions
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

   Replace `your_paypal_client_id`, `your_paypal_client_secret`, and `your_secret_key` with your actual PayPal API credentials and Flask secret key.

  The application is properly configured to load the `.env` variables. You can use the `python-dotenv` package to load environment variables from the `.env` file. Install it using:

   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv
   ```

2. **Setup PayPal API**

   Make sure to have your PayPal API credentials ready. You need to configure the PayPal SDK with your credentials to handle payment processing. You can add these credentials to your `.env` file as shown above. The PayPal API client will use these credentials to communicate with the PayPal services.

   Then, in the application setup (i.e., `app/__init__.py`), the environment variables are loaded like this:

   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   import os

   load_dotenv()

   # Example of accessing environment variables
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = os.getenv('PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID')
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv('PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET')
   SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
   ```

   The PayPal payment routes and configurations are correctly set up to use these environment variables.


4. **Setup the Database**:

## Setup the Database

Follow these steps to set up and initialize the database:

a. **Remove Existing Migrations Folder and Database File**:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf ./migrations/
   sudo rm -f ./instance/site.db
   ```

b. **Initialize the Migration Repository**:

   ```bash
   flask db init
   ```

c. **Generate an Initial Migration Script**:

   ```bash
   flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
   ```

d. **Apply the Migration to the Database**:

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

e. **Create the Admin User**:

   ```bash
   python create_admin.py
   ```

f. **Seed the Database with Initial Data**:

   ```bash
   python seed.py
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use the following command to initialize and seed the database:

   ```bash
   python db_setup_and_seed.py
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Running Tests

To run the tests for the project, use:

   ```bash
   python run_tests.py
   ```
   Alternatively, you can use the following command:

    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

This will run all the tests defined in the `tests` directory and ensure that everything is functioning as expected.
